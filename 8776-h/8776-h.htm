        Acted on May 24, 1671, at the Palais Royal, 'Les Fourberies de Scapin'
        had great success. It is nothing, however, but a farce, taken partly
        from classical, partly from Italian or from French sources.

      SCENE I.&mdash;OCTAVE, SILVESTRE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      OCT. Ah! what sad news for one in love! What a hard fate to be reduced to!
      So, Silvestre, you have just heard at the harbour that my father is coming
      back?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. That he returns this very morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. This very morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. With the intention of marrying me?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. Of marrying you.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. To a daughter of Mr. G本onte?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. Of Mr. G本onte.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. And that this daughter is on her way from Tarentum for that purpose?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. For that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. And you have this news from my uncle?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. From your uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. To whom my father has given all these particulars in a letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. In a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. And this uncle, you say, knows all about our doings?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. All our doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Oh! speak, I pray you; don't go on in such a way as that, and force
      me to wrench everything from you, word by word.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. But what is the use of my speaking? You don't forget one single
      detail, but state everything exactly as it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. At least advise me, and tell me what I ought to do in this wretched
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. I really feel as much perplexed as you, and I myself need the advice
      of some one to guide me.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. I am undone by this unforeseen return.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. And I no less.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. When my father hears what has taken place, a storm of reprimands will
      burst upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. Reprimands are not very heavy to bear; would to heaven I were free at
      that price! But I am very likely to pay dearly for all your wild doings,
      and I see a storm of blows ready to burst upon my shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Heavens! how am I to get clear of all the difficulties that beset my
      path!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. You should have thought of that before entering upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Oh, don't come and plague me to death with your unreasonable
      lectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. You plague me much more by your foolish deeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. What am I to do? What steps must I take? To what course of action
      have recourse?

    <h2>
      SCENE II.&mdash;OCTAVE, SCAPIN, SILVESTRE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SCA. How now, Mr. Octave? What is the matter with you? What is it? What
      trouble are you in? You are all upset, I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Ah! my dear Scapin, I am in despair; I am lost; I am the most
      unfortunate of mortals.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. How is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Don't you know anything of what has happened to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. My father is just returning with Mr. G本onte, and they want to marry
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Well, what is there so dreadful about that?
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Alas! you don't know what cause I have to be anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No; but it only depends on you that I should soon know; and I am a
      man of consolation, a man who can interest himself in the troubles of
      young people.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Ah! Scapin, if you could find some scheme, invent some plot, to get
      me out of the trouble I am in, I should think myself indebted to you for
      more than life.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. To tell you the truth, there are few things impossible to me when I
      once set about them. Heaven has bestowed on me a fair enough share of
      genius for the making up of all those neat strokes of mother wit, for all
      those ingenious gallantries to which the ignorant and vulgar give the name
      of impostures; and I can boast, without vanity, that there have been very
      few men more skilful than I in expedients and intrigues, and who have
      acquired a greater reputation in the noble profession. But, to tell the
      truth, merit is too ill rewarded nowadays, and I have given up everything
      of the kind since the trouble I had through a certain affair which
      happened to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. How? What affair, Scapin?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. An adventure in which justice and I fell out.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Justice and you?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes; we had a trifling quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. You and justice?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes. She used me very badly; and I felt so enraged against the
      ingratitude of our age that I determined never to do anything for anybody.
      But never mind; tell me about yourself all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. You know, Scapin, that two months ago Mr. G本onte and my father set
      out together on a voyage, about a certain business in which they are both
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes, I know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. And that both L伏ndre and I were left by our respective fathers, I
      under the management of Silvestre, and L伏ndre under your management.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes; I have acquitted myself very well of my charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Some time afterwards L伏ndre met with a young gipsy girl, with whom
      he fell in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I know that too.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. As we are great friends, he told me at once of his love, and took me
      to see this young girl, whom I thought good-looking, it is true, but not
      so beautiful as he would have had me believe. He never spoke of anything
      but her; at every opportunity he exaggerated her grace and her beauty,
      extolled her intelligence, spoke to me with transport of the charms of her
      conversation, and related to me her most insignificant saying, which he
      always wanted me to think the cleverest thing in the world. He often found
      fault with me for not thinking as highly as he imagined I ought to do of
      the things he related to me, and blamed me again and again for being so
      insensible to the power of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I do not see what you are aiming at in all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. One day, as I was going with him to the people who have charge of the
      girl with whom he is in love, we heard in a small house on a by-street,
      lamentations mixed with a good deal of sobbing. We inquired what it was,
      and were told by a woman that we might see there a most piteous sight, in
      the persons of two strangers, and that unless we were quite insensible to
      pity, we should be sure to be touched with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Where will this lead to?
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Curiosity made me urge L伏ndre to come in with me. We went into a low
      room, where we saw an old woman dying, and with her a servant who was
      uttering lamentations, and a young girl dissolved in tears, the most
      beautiful, the most touching sight that you ever saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Oh! oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Any other person would have seemed frightful in the condition she was
      in, for all the dress she had on was a scanty old petticoat, with a night
      jacket of plain fustian, and turned back at the top of her head a yellow
      cap, which let her hair fall in disorder on her shoulders; and yet dressed
      even thus she shone with a thousand attractions, and all her person was
      most charming and pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I begin to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Had you but seen her, Scapin, as I did, you would have thought her
      admirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Oh! I have no doubt about it; and without seeing her, I plainly
      perceive that she must have been altogether charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Her tears were none of those unpleasant tears which spoil the face;
      she had a most touching grace in weeping, and her sorrow was a most
      beautiful thing to witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I can see all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. All who approached her burst into tears whilst she threw herself, in
      her loving way, on the body of the dying woman, whom she called her dear
      mother; and nobody could help being moved to the depths of the heart to
      see a girl with such a loving disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes, all that is very touching; and I understand that this loving
      disposition made you love her.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Ah! Scapin, a savage would have loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Certainly; how could anyone help doing so?
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. After a few words, with which I tried to soothe her grief, we left
      her; and when I asked L伏ndre what he thought of her, he answered coldly
      that she was rather pretty! I was wounded to find how unfeelingly he spoke
      to me of her, and I would not tell him the effect her beauty had had on my
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. (<i>to</i> OCTAVE). If you do not abridge your story, we shall have
      to stop here till to-morrow. Leave it to me to finish it in a few words. (<i>To</i>
      SCAPIN) His heart takes fire from that moment. He cannot live without
      going to comfort the amiable and sorrowful girl. His frequent visits are
      forbidden by the servant, who has become her guardian by the death of the
      mother. Our young man is in despair; he presses, begs, beseeches&mdash;all
      in vain. He is told that the young girl, although without friends and
      without fortune, is of an honourable family, and that, unless he marries
      her, he must cease his visits. His love increases with the difficulties.
      He racks his brains; debates, reasons, ponders, and makes up his mind.
      And, to cut a long story short, he has been married these three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. Now, add to this the unforeseen return of the father, who was not to
      be back before two whole months; the discovery which the uncle has made of
      the marriage; and that other marriage projected between him and a daughter
      which Mr. G本onte had by a second wife, whom, they say, he married at
      Tarentum.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. And, above all, add also the poverty of my beloved, and the
      impossibility there is for me to do anything for her relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Is that all? You are both of you at a great loss about nothing. Is
      there any reason to be alarmed? Are you not ashamed, you, Silvestre, to
      fall short in such a small matter? Deuce take it all! You, big and stout
      as father and mother put together, you can't find any expedient in your
      noddle? you can't plan any stratagem, invent any gallant intrigue to put
      matters straight? Fie! Plague on the booby! I wish I had had the two old
      fellows to bamboozle in former times; I should not have thought much of
      it; and I was no bigger than that, when I had given a hundred delicate
      proofs of my skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. I acknowledge that Heaven has not given me your talent, and that I
      have not the brains like you to embroil myself with justice.
    </p>

      SCENE III.&mdash;HYACINTHA, OCTAVE, SCAPIN, SILVESTRE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      HYA. Ah! Octave, is what Silvestre has just told N本ine really true? Is
      your father back, and is he bent upon marrying you?
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Yes, it is so, dear Hyacintha; and these tidings have given me a
      cruel shock. But what do I see? You are weeping? Why those tears? Do you
      suspect me of unfaithfulness, and have you no assurance of the love I feel
      for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      HYA. Yes, Octave, I am sure that you love me now; but can I be sure that
      you will love me always?
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Ah! could anyone love you once without loving you for ever?
    </p>
    <p>
      HYA. I have heard say, Octave, that your sex does not love so long as
      ours, and that the ardour men show is a fire which dies out as easily as
      it is kindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Then, my dear Hyacintha, my heart is not like that of other men, and
      I feel certain that I shall love you till I die.
    </p>
    <p>
      HYA. I want to believe what you say, and I have no doubt that you are
      sincere; but I fear a power which will oppose in your heart the tender
      feelings you have for me. You depend on a father who would marry you to
      another, and I am sure it would kill me if such a thing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. No, lovely Hyacintha, there is no father who can force me to break my
      faith to you, and I could resolve to leave my country, and even to die,
      rather than be separated from you. Without having seen her, I have already
      conceived a horrible aversion to her whom they want me to marry; and
      although I am not cruel, I wish the sea would swallow her up, or drive her
      hence forever. Do not weep, then, dear Hyacintha, for your tears kill me,
      and I cannot see them without feeling pierced to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      HYA. Since you wish it, I will dry my tears, and I will wait without fear
      for what Heaven shall decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Heaven will be favourable to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      HYA. It cannot be against us if you are faithful.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. I certainly shall be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      HYA. Then I shall be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>aside</i>). She is not so bad, after all, and I think her pretty
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. (<i>showing</i> SCAPIN). Here is a man who, if he would, could be of
      the greatest help to us in all our trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I have sworn with many oaths never more to meddle with anything. But
      if you both entreat me very much, I might....
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Ah! if entreaties will obtain your help, I beseech you with all my
      heart to steer our bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>to</i> HYACINTHA). And you, have you anything to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      HYA. Like him, I beseech you, by all that is most dear to you upon earth,
      to assist us in our love.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I must have a little humanity, and give way. There, don't be afraid;
      I will do all I can for you.

      with firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. I confess that this meeting frightens me before hand, for with him I
      have a natural shyness that I cannot conquer.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes; you must be firm from the first, for fear that he should take
      advantage of your weakness, and lead you like a child. Now, come, try to
      school yourself into some amount of firmness, and be ready to answer
      boldly all he can say to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. I will do the best I can.
    </p>
    <p>

      us see how you will manage. Come, a look of decision, your head erect, a
      bold face.
    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. Like this.

      OCT. So?

      good-for-nothing fellow, you infamous rascal, unworthy son of such a
      father as I, dare you appear before me after what you have done, and after

    </p>
    <p>
      OCT. It is because I imagine I hear my father speaking.

      SCA. Why, yes; and it is for this reason that you must try not to look

      please. What! do you not think that I have every reason to be angry?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Quite so. I was angry myself when I first heard it; and I so far felt
      interested in your behalf that I rated your son well. Just ask him the
      fine sermons I gave him, and how I lectured him about the little respect
      he showed his father, whose very footsteps he ought to kiss. You could not
      yourself talk better to him. But what of that? I submitted to reason, and
      considered that, after all, he had done nothing so dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. What are you telling me? He has done nothing so dreadful? When he
      goes and marries straight off a perfect stranger?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. What can one do? he was urged to it by his destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Oh, oh! You give me there a fine reason. One has nothing better to do
      now than to commit the greatest crime imaginable&mdash;to cheat, steal,
      and murder&mdash;and give for an excuse that we were urged to it by
      destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Ah me! You take my words too much like a philosopher. I mean to say
      that he was fatally engaged in this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. And why did he engage in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Do you expect him to be as wise as you are? Can you put an old head
      on young shoulders, and expect young people to have all the prudence
      necessary to do nothing but what is reasonable? Just look at our L伏ndre,
      who, in spite of all my lessons, has done even worse than that. I should
      like to know whether you yourself were not young once, and have not played
      as many pranks as others? I have heard say that you were a sad fellow in
      your time, that you played the gallant among the most gallant of those
      days, and that you never gave in until you had gained your point.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. It is true, I grant it; but I always confined myself to gallantry,
      and never went so far as to do what he has done.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. But what was he to do? He sees a young person who wishes him well;
      for he inherits it from you that all women love him. He thinks her
      charming, goes to see her, makes love to her, sighs as lovers sigh, and
      does the passionate swain. She yields to his pressing visits; he pushes
      his fortune. But her relations catch him with her, and oblige him to marry
      her by main force.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. (<i>aside</i>). What a clever cheat!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Would you have him suffer them to murder him? It is still better to
      be married than to be dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I was not told that the thing had happened in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>showing</i> SILVESTRE). Ask him, if you like; he will tell you
      the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. (<i>to</i> SILVESTRE). Was he married against his wish?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Do you think I would tell you an untruth?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Then he should have gone at once to a lawyer to protest against the
      violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. It is the very thing he would not do.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Break off the marriage?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Yes
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. You will not break it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I shall not break it off?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No.

    <p>
      ARG. What! Have I not on my side the rights of a father, and can I not
      have satisfaction for the violence done to my son?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. This is a thing he will not consent to.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. He will not consent to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. My son?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Your son. Would you have him acknowledge that he was frightened, and
      that he yielded by force to what was wanted of him? He will take care not
      to confess that; it would be to wrong himself, and show himself unworthy
      of a father like you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I don't care for all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. He must, for his own honour and yours, say that he married of his own
      free will.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. And I wish for my own honour, and for his, that he should say the
      contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I am sure he will not do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I shall soon make him do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. He will not acknowledge it, I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. He shall do it, or I will disinherit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. You?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Nonsense!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. How nonsense?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. You will not disinherit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I shall not disinherit him?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No.
    </p>

      ARG. No?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Well! This is really too much! I shall not disinherit my son!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No, I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

      SCA. You yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes; you will never have the heart to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I shall have the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. You are joking.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I am not joking.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Paternal love will carry the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. No, it will not.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I tell you that I will disinherit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Rubbish.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. You may say rubbish; but I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Gracious me, I know that you are naturally a kind-hearted man.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. No, I am not kind-hearted; I can be angry when I choose. Leave off
      talking; you put me out of all patience. (<i>To</i> SYLVESTRE) Go, you
      rascal, run and fetch my son, while I go to Mr. G本onte and tell him of my
      misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Sir, if I can be useful to you in any way, you have but to order me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I thank you. (<i>Aside</i>) Ah! Why is he my only son? Oh! that I had
      with me the daughter that Heaven has taken away from me, so that I might
      make her my heir.

      have people dunning us.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      GER. Yes, there is no doubt but that with this weather we shall have our
      people with us to-day; and a sailor who has arrived from Tarentum told me
      just now that he had seen our man about to start with the ship. But my
      daughter's arrival will find things strangely altered from what we thought
      they would be, and what you have just told me of your son has put an end
      to all the plans we had made together.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Don't be anxious about that; I give you my word that I shall remove
      that obstacle, and I am going to see about it this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. In all good faith, Mr. Argante, shall I tell you what? The education
      of children is a thing that one could never be too careful about.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. You are right; but why do you say that?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Because most of the follies of young men come from the way they have
      been brought up by their fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. It is so sometimes, certainly; but what do you mean by saying that to
      me?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Why do I say that to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Because, if, like a courageous father, you had corrected your son
      when he was young, he would not have played you such a trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I see. So that you have corrected your own much better?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Certainly; and I should be very sorry if he had done anything at all
      like what yours has done.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. And if that son, so well brought up, had done worse even than mine,
      what would you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I mean, Mr. G本onte, that we should never be so ready to blame the
      conduct of others, and that those who live in glass houses should not
      throw stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. I really do not understand you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I will explain myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Have you heard anything about my son?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Perhaps I have.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. But what?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Your servant Scapin, in his vexation, only told me the thing roughly,
      and you can learn all the particulars from him or from some one else. For
      my part, I will at once go to my solicitor, and see what steps I can take
      in the matter. Good-bye.

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      LEA. I was wrong, I acknowledge.

      OCTAVE) As far as yours is concerned, my plan is all ready. (<i>To</i>
      L테NDRE) And as for yours, although he is the greatest miser imaginable,
      we shall find it easier still; for you know that he is not blessed with
      too much intellect, and I look upon him as a man who will believe
      anything. This cannot offend you; there is not a suspicion of a
      resemblance between him and you; and you know what the world thinks, that
      he is your father only in name.

      SCENE VIII.&mdash;ARGANTE, SCAPIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>aside</i>). Here he is, turning it over in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. (<i>thinking himself alone</i>). Such behaviour and such lack of
      consideration! To entangle himself in an engagement like that! Ah! rash
      youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Your servant, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Good morning, Scapin.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. You are thinking of your son's conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Yes, I acknowledge that it grieves me deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Ah! Sir, life is full of troubles; and we should always be prepared
      for them. I was told, a long time ago, the saying of an ancient
      philosopher which I have never forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. What was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. That if the father of a family has been away from home for ever so
      short a time, he ought to dwell upon all the sad news that may greet him
      on his return. He ought to fancy his house burnt down, his money stolen,
      his wife dead, his son married, his daughter ruined; and be very thankful
      for whatever falls short of all this. In my small way of philosophy, I
      have ever taken this lesson to heart; and I never come home but I expect
      to have to bear with the anger of my masters, their scoldings, insults,
      kicks, blows, and horse-whipping. And I always thank my destiny for
      whatever I do not receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. That's all very well; but this rash marriage is more than I can put
      up with, and it forces me to break off the match I had intended for my
      son. I have come from my solicitor's to see if we can cancel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Well, Sir, if you will take my advice, you will look to some other
      way of settling this business. You know what a law-suit means in this
      country, and you'll find yourself in the midst of a strange bush of
      thorns.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I am fully aware that you are quite right; but what else can I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I think I have found something that will answer much better. The
      sorrow that I felt for you made me rummage in my head to find some means
      of getting you out of trouble; for I cannot bear to see kind fathers a
      prey to grief without feeling sad about it, and, besides, I have at all
      times had the greatest regard for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I am much obliged to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Then you must know that I went to the brother of the young girl whom
      your son has married. He is one of those fire-eaters, one of those men all
      sword-thrusts, who speak of nothing but fighting, and who think no more of
      killing a man than of swallowing a glass of wine. I got him to speak of
      this marriage; I showed him how easy it would be to have it broken off,
      because of the violence used towards your son. I spoke to him of your
      prerogatives as father, and of the weight which your rights, your money,
      and your friends would have with justice. I managed him so that at last he
      lent a ready ear to the propositions I made to him of arranging the matter
      amicably for a sum of money. In short, he will give his consent to the
      marriage being cancelled, provided you pay him well.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. And how much did he ask?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Oh! at first things utterly out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. But what?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Things utterly extravagant.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. But what?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. He spoke of no less than five or six hundred pistoles.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Five or six hundred agues to choke him withal. Does he think me a
      fool?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Just what I told him. I laughed his proposal to scorn, and made him
      understand that you were not a man to be duped in that fashion, and of
      whom anyone can ask five or six hundred pistoles! However, after much
      talking, this is what we decided upon. "The time is now come," he said,
      "when I must go and rejoin the army. I am buying my equipments, and the
      want of money I am in forces me to listen to what you propose. I must have
      a horse, and I cannot obtain one at all fit for the service under sixty
      pistoles."
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Well, yes; I am willing to give sixty pistoles.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. He must have the harness and pistols, and that will cost very nearly
      twenty pistoles more.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Twenty and sixty make eighty.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. It's a great deal; still, I consent to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. He must also have a horse for his servant, which, we may expect, will
      cost at least thirty pistoles.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. How, the deuce! Let him go to Jericho. He shall have nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Sir!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. No; he's an insolent fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Would you have his servant walk?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Let him get along as he pleases, and the master too.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Now, Sir, really don't go and hesitate for so little. Don't have
      recourse to law, I beg of you, but rather give all that is asked of you,
      and save yourself from the clutches of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Well, well! I will bring myself to give these thirty pistoles also.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. "I must also have," he said, "a mule to carry...."
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Let him go to the devil with his mule! This is asking too much. We
      will go before the judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I beg of you, Sir!
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. No, I will not give in.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Sir, only one small mule.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. No; not even an ass.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Consider....
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. No, I tell you; I prefer going to law.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Ah! Sir, what are you talking about, and what a resolution you are
      going to take. Just cast a glance on the ins and outs of justice, look at
      the number of appeals, of stages of jurisdiction; how many embarrassing
      procedures; how many ravening wolves through whose claws you will have to
      pass; serjeants, solicitors, counsel, registrars, substitutes, recorders,
      judges and their clerks. There is not one of these who, for the merest
      trifle, couldn't knock over the best case in the world. A serjeant will
      issue false writs without your knowing anything of it. Your solicitor will
      act in concert with your adversary, and sell you for ready money. Your
      counsel, bribed in the same way, will be nowhere to be found when your
      case comes on, or else will bring forward arguments which are the merest
      shooting in the air, and will never come to the point. The registrar will
      issue writs and decrees against you for contumacy. The recorder's clerk
      will make away with some of your papers, or the instructing officer
      himself will not say what he has seen, and when, by dint of the wariest
      possible precautions, you have escaped all these traps, you will be amazed
      that your judges have been set against you either by bigots or by the
      women they love. Ah! Sir, save yourself from such a hell, if you can. 'Tis
      damnation in this world to have to go to law; and the mere thought of a
      lawsuit is quite enough to drive me to the other end of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. How much does he want for the mule?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. For the mule, for his horse and that of his servant, for the harness
      and pistols, and to pay a little something he owes at the hotel, he asks
      altogether two hundred pistoles, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Two hundred pistoles?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. (<i>walking about angrily</i>). No, no; we will go to law.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Recollect what you are doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I shall go to law.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Don't go and expose yourself to....
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I will go to law.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. But to go to law you need money. You must have money for the summons,
      you must have money for the rolls, for prosecution, attorney's
      introduction, solicitor's advice, evidence, and his days in court. You
      must have money for the consultations and pleadings of the counsel, for
      the right of withdrawing the briefs, and for engrossed copies of the
      documents. You must have money for the reports of the substitutes, for the
      court fees {1} at the conclusion, for registrar's enrolment, drawing up of
      deeds, sentences, decrees, rolls, signings, and clerks' despatches;
      letting alone all the presents you will have to make. Give this money to
      the man, and there you are well out of the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      {1} <i>텷ices</i>, "spices," in ancient times, equalled <i>sweetmeats</i>,
      and were given to the judge by the side which gained the suit, as a mark
      of gratitude. These <i>馥ices</i> had long been changed into a compulsory
      payment of money when Moli半e wrote. In Racine's <i>Plaideurs</i>, act ii.
      scene vii., Petit Jean takes literally the demand of the judge for <i>馥ices</i>,
      and fetches the pepper-box to satisfy him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Two hundred pistoles!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes, and you will save by it. I have made a small calculation in my
      head of all that justice costs, and I find that by giving two hundred
      pistoles to your man you will have a large margin left&mdash;say, at least
      a hundred and fifty pistoles&mdash;without taking into consideration the
      cares, troubles, and anxieties, which you will spare yourself. For were it
      only to avoid being before everybody the butt of some facetious counsel, I
      had rather give three hundred pistoles than go to law. {Footnote: What
      would Moli半e have said if he had been living now!}
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I don't care for that, and I challenge all the lawyers to say
      anything against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. You will do as you please, but in your place I would avoid a lawsuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I will never give two hundred pistoles.

      (ARGANTE <i>hides, trembling, behind</i> SCAPIN.)

      delivered you of that rascally knave, of that scoundrel Argante. Trust me.

      Ah! s'death! ah! s'blood! Why can I not meet him at this very moment, with
      all these relations and friends of his? If he would only appear before me,
      surrounded by a score of them! Why do they not fall upon me, arms in hand?
      (<i>Standing upon his guard</i>.) What! you villains! you dare to attack
      me? Now, s'death! Kill and slay! (<i>He lunges out on all sides; as if he

      SCENE X.&mdash;ARGANTE, SCAPIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SCA. Well, Sir, you see how many people are killed for two hundred
      pistoles. Now I wish you a good morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. (<i>all trembling</i>). Scapin.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. What do you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I will give the two hundred pistoles.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I am very glad of it, for your sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Let us go to him; I have them with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Better give them to me. You must not, for your honour, appear in this
      business, now that you have passed for another; and, besides, I should be
      afraid that he would ask you for more, if he knew who you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. True; still I should be glad to see to whom I give my money.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Do you mistrust me then?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Oh no; but....
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Zounds! Sir; either I am a thief or an honest man; one or the other.
      Do you think I would deceive you, and that in all this I have any other
      interest at heart than yours and that of my master, whom you want to take
      into your family? If I have not all your confidence, I will have no more
      to do with all this, and you can look out for somebody else to get you out
      of the mess.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Here then.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No, Sir; do not trust your money to me. I would rather you trusted
      another with your message.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Ah me! here, take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No, no, I tell you; do not trust me. Who knows if I do not want to
      steal your money from you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. Take it, I tell you, and don't force me to ask you again. However,
      mind you have an acknowledgment from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Trust me; he hasn't to do with an idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARG. I will go home and wait for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I shall be sure to go. (<i>Alone</i>.) That one's all right; now for

      SCENE XI.&mdash;GRONTE, SCAPIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>affecting not to see</i> GRONTE). O Heaven! O unforeseen
      misfortune! O unfortunate father! Poor G本onte, what will you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>aside</i>). What is he saying there with that doleful face?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Can no one tell me whereto find Mr. G本onte?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What is the matter, Scapin?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>running about on the stage, and still affecting not to see or
      hear</i> GRONTE). Where could I meet him, to tell him of this misfortune?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>stopping</i> SCAPIN). What is the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>as before</i>). In vain I run everywhere to meet him. I cannot
      find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Here I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>as before</i>). He must have hidden himself in some place which
      nobody can guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>stopping</i> SCAPIN <i>again</i>). Ho! I say, are you blind?
      Can't you see me?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Ah! Sir, it is impossible to find you.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. I have been near you for the last half-hour. What is it all about?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Sir....
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Well!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Your son, Sir....
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Well! My son....
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Has met with the strangest misfortune you ever heard of.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. This afternoon I found him looking very sad about something which you
      had said to him, and in which you had very improperly mixed my name. While
      trying: to dissipate his sorrow, we went and walked about in the harbour.
      There, among other things, was to be seen a Turkish galley. A young Turk,
      with a gentlemanly look about him, invited us to go in, and held out his
      hand to us. We went in. He was most civil to us; gave us some lunch, with
      the most excellent fruit and the best wine you have ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What is there so sad about all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Wait a little; it is coming. Whilst we were eating, the galley left
      the harbour, and when in the open sea, the Turk made me go down into a
      boat, and sent me to tell you that unless you sent by me five hundred
      crowns, he would take your son prisoner to Algiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What! five hundred crowns!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes, Sir; and, moreover, he only gave me two hours to find them in.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Ah! the scoundrel of a Turk to murder me in that fashion!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. It is for you, Sir, to see quickly about the means of saving from
      slavery a son whom you love so tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What the deuce did he want to go in that galley for? {Footnote: <i>Que
      diable allait-il faire dans cette gal半e?</i> This sentence has become
      established in the language with the meaning, "Whatever business had he
      there?"}
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. He had no idea of what would happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Go, Scapin, go quickly, and tell that Turk that I shall send the
      police after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. The police in the open sea! Are you joking?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What the deuce did he want to go in that galley for?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. A cruel destiny will sometimes lead people.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Listen, Scapin; you must act in this the part of a faithful servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. How, Sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. You must go and tell that Turk that he must send me back my son, and
      that you will take his place until I have found the sum he asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Ah! Sir; do you know what you are saying? and do you fancy that that
      Turk will be foolish enough to receive a poor wretch like me in your son's
      stead?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What the deuce did he want to go in that galley for?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. He could not foresee his misfortune. However, Sir, remember that he
      has given me only two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. You say that he asks....
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Five hundred crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Five hundred crowns! Has he no conscience?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Ah! ah! Conscience in a Turk!
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Does he understand what five hundred crowns are?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes, Sir, he knows that five hundred crowns are one thousand five
      hundred francs. {Footnote: The <i>匐u</i> stands usually for <i>petit 匐u</i>,
      which equalled three franks. "Crown," employed in a general sense, seems
      the only translation possible.}
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Does the scoundrel think that one thousand five hundred francs are to
      be found in the gutter?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Such people will never listen to reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. But what the deuce did he want to go in that galley for?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Ah! what a waste of words! Leave the galley alone; remember that time
      presses, and that you are running the risk of losing your son for ever.
      Alas! my poor master, perhaps I shall never see you again, and that at
      this very moment, whilst I am speaking to you, they are taking you away to
      make a slave of you in Algiers! But Heaven is my witness that I did all I
      could, and that, if you are not brought back, it is all owing to the want
      of love of your father.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Wait a minute, Scapin; I will go and fetch that sum of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Be quick, then, for I am afraid of not being in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. You said four hundred crowns; did you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No, five hundred crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Five hundred crowns!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What the deuce did he want to go in that galley for?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Quite right, but be quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Could he not have chosen another walk?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. It is true; but act promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Cursed galley!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>aside</i>) That galley sticks in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Here, Scapin; I had forgotten that I have just received this sum in
      gold, and I had no idea it would so soon be wrenched from me. (<i>Taking
      his purse out of his pocket, and making as if he were giving it to</i>
      SCAPIN.) But mind you tell that Turk that he is a scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>holding out his hand</i>). Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>as above</i>). An infamous wretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>still holding out his hand</i>). Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>as above</i>). A man without conscience, a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Leave that to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>as above</i>). That....
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. All right.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>as above</i>). And that, if ever I catch him, he will pay for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>putting back the purse in his pocket</i>). Go, go quickly, and
      fetch my son.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>running after him</i>). Hallo! Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. And the money?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Did I not give it to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No, indeed, you put it back in pour pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Ah! it is grief which troubles my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. So I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What the deuce did he want to go in that galley for? Ah! cursed
      galley! Scoundrel of a Turk! May the devil take you!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCAPIN (<i>alone</i>). He can't get over the five hundred crowns I wrench
      from him; but he has not yet done with me, and I will make him pay in a
      different money his imposture about me to his son.

    <h2>
      SCENE I.&mdash;ZERBINETTE, HYACINTHA, SCAPIN, SILVESTRE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SIL. Yes; your lovers have decided that you should be together, and we are
      acting according to their orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      HYA. (<i>to</i> ZERBINETTE). Such an order has nothing in it but what is
      pleasant to me. I receive such a companion with joy, and it will not be my
      fault if the friendship which exists between those we love does not exist
      also between us two.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. I accept the offer, and I am not one to draw back when friendship is
      asked of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. And when it is love that is asked of you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. Ah! love is a different thing. One runs more risk, and I feel less
      determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. You are determined enough against my master, and yet what he has just
      done for you ought to give you confidence enough to respond to his love as
      you should.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. As yet I only half trust him, and what he has just done is not
      sufficient to reassure me. I am of a happy disposition, and am very fond
      of fun, it is true. But though I laugh, I am serious about many things;
      and your master will find himself deceived if he thinks that it is
      sufficient for him to have bought me, for me to be altogether his. He will
      have to give something else besides money, and for me to answer to his
      love as he wishes me, he must give me his word, with an accompaniment of
      certain little ceremonies which are thought indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. It is so he understands this matter. He only wants you as his wife,
      and I am not a man to have mixed in this business if he had meant anything
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. I believe it since you say so; but I foresee certain difficulties
      with the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. We shall find a way of settling that.
    </p>
    <p>
      HYA. (<i>to</i> ZERBINETTE). The similarity of our fate ought to
      strengthen the tie of friendship between us. We are both subject to the
      same fears, both exposed to the same misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. You have this advantage at least that you know who your parents are,
      and that, sure of their help, when you wish to make them known, you can
      secure your happiness by obtaining a consent to the marriage you have
      contracted. But I, on the contrary, have no such hope to fall back upon,
      and the position I am in is little calculated to satisfy the wishes of a
      father whose whole care is money.
    </p>
    <p>
      HYA. That is true; but you have this in your favour, that the one you love
      is under no temptation of contracting another marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. A change in a lover's heart is not what we should fear the most. We
      may justly rely on our own power to keep the conquest we have made; but
      what I particularly dread is the power of the fathers; for we cannot
      expect to see them moved by our merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      HYA. Alas! Why must the course of true love never run smooth? How sweet it
      would be to love with no link wanting in those chains which unite two
      hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. How mistaken you are about this! Security in love forms a very
      unpleasant calm. Constant happiness becomes wearisome. We want ups and
      downs in life; and the difficulties which generally beset our path in this
      world revive us, and increase our sense of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. Do tell us, Scapin, all about that stratagem of yours, which, I was
      told, is so very amusing; and how you managed to get some money out of
      your old miser. You know that the trouble of telling me something amusing
      is not lost upon me, and that I well repay those who take that trouble by
      the pleasure it gives me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Silvestre here will do that as well as I. I am nursing in my heart a
      certain little scheme of revenge which I mean to enjoy thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. Why do you recklessly engage in enterprises that may bring you into
      trouble?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I delight in dangerous enterprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. As I told you already, you would give up the idea you have if you
      would listen to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I prefer listening to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. Why the deuce do you engage in such a business?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Why the deuce do you trouble yourself about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. It is because I can see that you will without necessity bring a storm
      of blows upon yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Ah, well, it will be on my shoulders, and not on yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIL. It is true that you are master of your own shoulders, and at liberty
      to dispose of them as you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Such dangers never stop me, and I hate those fearful hearts which, by
      dint of thinking of what may happen, never undertake anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. (<i>to</i> SCAPIN). But we shall want you.

      SCENE II.&mdash;GRONTE, SCAPIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      GER. Well! Scapin, and how have we succeeded about my son's mischance?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Your son is safe, Sir; but you now run the greatest danger
      imaginable, and I sincerely wish you were safe in your house.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. How is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. While I am speaking to you, there are people who are looking out for
      you everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. For me?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. But who?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. The brother of that young girl whom Octave has married. He thinks
      that you are trying to break off that match, because you intend to give to
      your daughter the place she occupies in the heart of Octave; and he has
      resolved to wreak his vengeance upon you. All his friends, men of the
      sword like himself, are looking out for you, and are seeking you
      everywhere. I have met with scores here and there, soldiers of his
      company, who question every one they meet, and occupy in companies all the
      thoroughfares leading to your house, so that you cannot go home either to
      the right or the left without falling into their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What can I do, my dear Scapin?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I am sure I don't know, Sir; it is an unpleasant business. I tremble
      for you from head to foot and.... Wait a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      (SCAPIN <i>goes to see in the back of the stage if there is anybody coming</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>trembling</i>). Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>coming back</i>). No, no; 'tis nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Could you not find out some means of saving me?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I can indeed think of one, but I should run the risk of a sound
      beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Ah! Scapin, show yourself a devoted servant. Do not forsake me, I
      pray you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I will do what I can. I feel for you a tenderness which renders it
      impossible for me to leave you without help.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Be sure that I will reward you for it, Scapin, and I promise you this
      coat of mine when it is a little more worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Wait a minute. I have just thought, at the proper moment, of the very
      thing to save you. You must get into this sack, and I....
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>thinking he sees somebody</i>). Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No, no, no, no; 'tis nobody. As I was saying, you must get in here,
      and must be very careful not to stir. I will put you on my shoulders, and
      carry you like a bundle of something or other. I shall thus be able to
      take you through your enemies, and see you safe into your house. When
      there, we will barricade the door and send for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. A very good idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. The best possible. You will see. (<i>Aside</i>) Ah! you shall pay me
      for that lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I only say that your enemies will be finely caught. Get in right to
      the bottom, and, above all things, be careful not to show yourself and not
      to move, whatever may happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. You may trust me to keep still.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Hide yourself; here comes one of the bullies! He is looking for you.
      (<i>Altering his voice</i>.) {Footnote: All the parts within inverted
      commas are supposed to be spoken by the man Scapin is personating; the
      rest by himself.} "Vat! I shall not hab de pleasure to kill dis G本onte,
      and one vill not in sharity show me vere is he?" (<i>To</i> GRONTE, <i>in
      his ordinary tone</i>) Do not stir. "Pardi! I vill find him if he lied in
      de mittle ob de eart" (<i>To</i> GRONTE, <i>in his natural tone</i>) Do
      not show yourself. "Ho! you man vid a sack!" Sir! "I will give thee a
      pound if thou vilt tell me where dis G本onte is." You are looking for Mr.
      G本onte? "Yes, dat I am." And on what business, Sir? "For vat pusiness?"
      Yes. "I vill, pardi! trash him vid one stick to dead." Oh! Sir, people
      like him are not thrashed with sticks, and he is not a man to be treated
      so. "Vat! dis fob of a G本onte, dis prute, dis cat." Mr. G本onte, Sir, is
      neither a fop, a brute, nor a cad; and you ought, if you please, to speak
      differently. "Vat! you speak so mighty vit me?" I am defending, as I
      ought, an honourable man who is maligned. "Are you one friend of dis
      G本onte?" Yes, Sir, I am. "Ah, ah! You are one friend of him, dat is goot
      luck!" (<i>Beating the sack several times with the stick</i>.) "Here is
      vat I give you for him." (<i>Calling out as if he received the beating</i>)
      Ah! ah! ah! ah! Sir. Ah! ah! Sir, gently! Ah! pray. Ah! ah! ah! "Dere,
      bear him dat from me. Goot-pye." Ah! the wretch. Ah!...ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>looking out</i>). Ah! Scapin, I can bear it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Ah! Sir, I am bruised all over, and my shoulders are as sore as can
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. How! It was on mine he laid his stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I beg your pardon, Sir, it was on my back.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What do you mean? I am sure I felt the blows, and feel them still.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. No, I tell you; it was only the end of his stick that reached your
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. You should have gone a little farther back, then, to spare me,
      and....
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>pushing</i> GRONTE'S <i>head back into the sack</i>). Take care,
      here is another man who looks like a foreigner. "Frient, me run like one
      Dutchman, and me not fint all de tay dis treatful G本onte." Hide yourself
      well. "Tell me, you, Sir gentleman, if you please, know you not vere is
      dis G本onte, vat me look for?" No, Sir, I do not know where G本onte is.
      "Tell me, trutful, me not vant much vit him. Only to gife him one tosen
      plows vid a stick, and two or tree runs vid a swort tro' his shest." I
      assure you, Sir, I do not know where he is. "It seems me I see sometink
      shake in dat sack." Excuse me, Sir. "I pe shure dere is sometink or oder
      in dat sack." Not at all, Sir. "Me should like to gife one plow of de
      swort in dat sack." Ah! Sir, beware, pray you, of doing so. "Put, show me
      ten vat to be dere?" Gently, Sir. "Why chently?" You have nothing to do
      with what I am carrying. "And I, put I vill see." You shall not see. "Ah!
      vat trifling." It is some clothes of mine. "Show me tem, I tell you." I
      will not. "You vill not?" No. "I make you feel this shtick upon de
      sholders." I don't care. "Ah! you vill poast!" (<i>Striking the sack, and
      calling out as if he were beaten</i>) Oh! oh! oh! Oh! Sir. Oh! oh!
      "Goot-bye, dat is one littel lesson teach you to speak so insolent." Ah!
      plague the crazy jabberer! Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>looking out of the sack</i>). Ah! all my bones are broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Ah! I am dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Why the deuce do they strike on my back?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. (<i>pushing his head back into the bag</i>). Take care; I see half a
      dozen soldiers coming together. (<i>Imitating the voices of several people</i>.)
      "Now, we must discover G本onte; let us look everywhere carefully. We must
      spare no trouble, scour the town, and not forget one single spot Let us
      search on all sides. Which way shall we go? Let us go that way. No, this.
      On the left. On the right. No; yes." (<i>To</i> GRONTE <i>in his ordinary
      voice</i>) Hide yourself well. "Ah! here is his servant. I say, you
      rascal, you must tell us where your master is. Speak. Be quick. At once.
      Make haste. Now." Ah! gentlemen, one moment. (GRONTE <i>looks quietly out
      of the bag, and sees</i> SCAPIN'S <i>trick</i>.) "If you do not tell us at
      once where your master is, we will shower a rain of blows on your back." I
      had rather suffer anything than tell you where my master is. "Very well,
      we will cudgel you soundly." Do as you please. "You want to be beaten,
      then?" I will never betray my master. "Ah! you will have it&mdash;there."
      Oh!

      SCENE III.&mdash;ZERBINETTE, GRONTE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ZER. (<i>laughing, without seeing</i> GRONTE). Ah, ah! I must really come
      and breathe a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>aside, not seeing</i> ZERBINETTE). Ah! I will make you pay for

    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. (<i>not seeing</i> GRONTE). Ah, ah, ah, ah! What an amusing story!
      What a good dupe that old man is!
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. This is no matter for laughter; and you have no business to laugh at
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. Why? What do you mean, Sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. I mean to say that you ought not to laugh at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. Laugh at you?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. How! Who is thinking of laughing at you?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Why do you come and laugh in my face?
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. This has nothing to do with you. I am only laughing with myself at
      the remembrance of a story which has just been told me. The most amusing
      story in the world. I don't know if it is because I am interested in the
      matter, but I never heard anything so absurd as the trick that has just
      been played by a son to his father to get some money out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. By a son to his father to get some money out of him?
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. Yes; and if you are at all desirous of hearing how it was done, I
      will tell you the whole affair. I have a natural longing for imparting to
      others the funny things I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. Pray, tell me that story.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. Willingly. I shall not risk much by telling it you, for it is an
      adventure which is not likely to remain secret long. Fate placed me among
      one of those bands of people who are called gypsies, and who, tramping
      from province to province, tell you your fortune, and do many other things
      besides. When we came to this town, I met a young man, who, on seeing me,
      fell in love with me. From that moment he followed me everywhere; and,
      like all young men, he imagined that he had but to speak and things would
      go on as he liked; but he met with a pride which forced him to think
      twice. He spoke of his love to the people in whose power I was, and found
      them ready to give me up for a certain sum of money. But the sad part of
      the business was that my lover found himself exactly in the same condition
      as most young men of good family, that is, without any money at all. His
      father, although rich, is the veriest old skinflint and greatest miser you
      ever heard of. Wait a moment&mdash;what is his name? I don't remember it&mdash;can't
      you help me? Can't you name some one in this town who is known to be the
      most hard-fisted old miser in the place?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. There is in his name some Ron...Ronte... Or...Oronte...No.
      G...G本onte. Yes, G本onte, that's my miser's name. I have it now; it is
      the old churl I mean. Well, to come back to our story. Our people wished
      to leave this town to-day, and my lover would have lost me through his
      lack of money if, in order to wrench some out of his father, he had not
      made use of a clever servant he has. As for that servant's name, I
      remember it very well. His name is Scapin. He is a most wonderful man, and
      deserves the highest praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. (<i>aside</i>). Ah, the wretch!
    </p>
    <p>
      ZER. But just listen to the plan he adopted to take in his dupe&mdash;ah!
      ah! ah! ah! I can't think of it without laughing heartily&mdash;ah! ah!
      ah! He went to that old screw&mdash;ah! ah! ah!&mdash;and told him that
      while he was walking about the harbour with his son&mdash;ah! ah!&mdash;they
      noticed a Turkish galley; that a young Turk had invited them to come in
      and see it; that he had given them some lunch&mdash;ah! ah!&mdash;and
      that, while they were at table, the galley had gone into the open sea;
      that the Turk had sent him alone back, with the express order to say to
      him that, unless he sent him five hundred crowns, he would take his son to
      be a slave in Algiers&mdash;ah, ah, ah! You may imagine our miser, our
      stingy old curmudgeon, in the greatest anguish, struggling between his
      love for his son and his love for his money. Those five hundred crowns
      that are asked of him are five hundred dagger-thrusts&mdash;ah! ah! ah!
      ah! He can't bring his mind to tear out, as it were, this sum from his
      heart, and his anguish makes him think of the most ridiculous means to
      find money for his son's ransom&mdash;ah! ah! ah! He wants to send the
      police into the open sea after the Turk's galley&mdash;ah! ah! ah! He asks
      his servant to take the place of his son till he has found the money to
      pay for him&mdash;money he has no intention of giving&mdash;ah! ah! ah! He
      yields up, to make the five hundred crowns, three or four old suits which
      are not worth thirty&mdash;ah! ah! ah! The servant shows him each time how
      absurd is what he proposes, and each reflection of the old fellow is
      accompanied by an agonising, "But what the deuce did he want to go in that
      galley for? Ah! cursed galley. Ah! scoundrel of a Turk!" At last, after
      many hesitations, after having sighed and groaned for a long time...But it
      seems to me that my story does not make you laugh; what do you say to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      GER. What I say? That the young man is a scoundrel&mdash;a
      good-for-nothing fellow&mdash;who will be punished by his father for the
      trick he has played him; that the gypsy girl is a bold, impudent hussy to
      come and insult a man of honour, who will give her what she deserves for
      coming here to debauch the sons of good families; and that the servant is
      an infamous wretch, whom G本onte will take care to have hung before
      to-morrow is over.

      other wife.

      will be sure to make you like her when you know her.

      brother is in love, and who told me to my face so many insulting things?

      love my brother has for her is pure.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
